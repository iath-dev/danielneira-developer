# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with Astro.

## About

This project showcases my skills and experience as a full-stack developer. It is designed to be a living project, and I will be continuously updating it with new features and content.

## Future Plans

I am planning to integrate this portfolio with a REST API to dynamically load project data and other content. This will allow me to easily manage my portfolio content without having to redeploy the entire site.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed.

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2.  Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start the development server: `npm run dev`
