## About

This project is a full-stack task management application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. The front end is built with React and Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and responsive user interface. The back end is powered by FastAPI, a high-performance Python web framework, and uses a PostgreSQL database to store task data.

### Features

- **Create and Manage Tasks:** Users can easily create, update, and delete tasks.
- **User Authentication:** The application includes user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access their tasks.
- **Team Collaboration:** The application is designed to support team collaboration, allowing users to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.
- **Full-stack Architecture:** The project demonstrates a full-stack architecture, with a clear separation between the front-end and back-end components.
